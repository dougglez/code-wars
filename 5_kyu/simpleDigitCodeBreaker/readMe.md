Description:

In this kata, you have to break a code of 3 digits. The tryCode() function is called in loop with a max of 10 attempts. It have to return an array of 3 digits.

During the first call, the "indications" parameter is null, then it is the result array of the confrontation between last proposition and solution. You may have 3 different values:

0 means the proposed digit is correct
1 means the proposed digit is lower than the correct one
-1 means the proposed digit is higher than the correct one
Pseudo-algorithm example :

solution is randomly created, in this example this [1,2,3]
tryCode(null) => [0, 2, 4] // for the first call, indications is null, we assume that it returns [0,2,4]
tryCode([1, 0, -1]) // [0, 2, 4] isn't the solution, so tryCode() is called again, with the indications [1, 0, -1] as explained above : 0 below 1 => 1 ; 2 == 2 => 0 ; 4 above 3 => -1
...so on, until tryCode() returns the solution or it is called up to 10 times (to avoid a brute force)
