Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

All inputs will be integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

A few examples:

arithmetic(5, 2, "add") should return 7

arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") should return 3

arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") should return 10

arithmetic(5, 2, "divide") should return 2.5

Try to do it without using if statements!
